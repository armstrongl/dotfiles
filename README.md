# My Vim Configuration

This is my custom configuration for using Vim as an IDE for Golang.

Before you start using this `.vimrc` file, you'll need to make sure Vim is updated. It's best to compile it from source, that way you won't have to add anyone else's PPAs. 

1. [Update Vim](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source). 
2. Install Vim Plug. 
3. Clone the `.vimrc` file to your home directory. 
4. Open the `.vimrc` file, then run `:PlugInstall` to install all the plugins. 

A few tips: 
- To access nerdtree, press `CTRL` + `T`. 
- To switch from nerdtree back to the file editor, press `CTRL` + `ww`.
